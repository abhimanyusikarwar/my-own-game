I will going to create a war game in which 13 JAK forces are tasked to recapture the points of tiger hill
There two points that have to be recaptured from the pakistani troops.
1st point is 4574
this point have to be recaptured first because this is the point where the most powrfull weapons are there.
this point supply's weapons to point 5353 so if this point is recaptured then we can bloch the smugling of weapons to point 5353.
the next point is 5353 this point is to difficult too recapture because this point is very to in the sky.
If  the enemy see us so it's going too be impossible to recapture it so 13JAK have to find a way from which  we can climb and also 
the enemy can't see us.This point is also important too recapture because it cover's an area of 70km and if we failed to recapture it
then the enemy will get the chance to block the national highway1 and Srinagar will be captured by pakistan.
